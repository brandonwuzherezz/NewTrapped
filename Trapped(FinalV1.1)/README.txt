Goal/Objective/Obstacles
------------------------
“Trapped” is a cell shaded exploration and puzzle game where the player takes
 the roll of a young female protagonist searching an abandoned mansion
 for her lost brother. Along the way you may encounter menacing shadows 
that can take the shape of random objects in the mansion and face perilous
 puzzles. While the player wanders through the mansion, they can also find
 batteries to recharge their flashlights – essential to staving off the darkness. 
Utilizing this limited source of light, the player must traverse past threatening 
shadows as well as explore the mansion to reach the end. However, if the player
 is attacked by the shadows or run out for batteries, they run the risk of
 getting lost and trapped within the mansion, FOREVER!
